# Real-Time Chat Application

A simple real-time chat application built with **Node.js** and **Socket.IO**. This application allows users to join the chat, send and receive messages, and be notified when users join or leave the chat. The UI is responsive and includes a gradient background with clear visual differentiation between incoming and outgoing messages.

## Features
- **Real-time messaging** using **Socket.IO**.
- **User notifications** when someone joins or leaves the chat.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: The design is fully responsive, making it work well on both mobile and desktop devices.
